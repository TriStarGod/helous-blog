Back in June my Father had back surgery. It was already a stressful time but to make matters worse only my Mother was allowed to visit him and she was restricted on the hours she was allowed to visit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When she would return in the late morning she would return to find that my dad hadn’t been ordered any food and had medications that he had to take hours ago. He had been left there all morning, without any food because hospital staff were overrun and the ban on visitors meant no one could handle this task for him. When I first heard about this I was shocked. For a family to not be allowed to see their family members when they are in the hospital and be forced to trust hospitals fully with their well-being is a great ask. I knew at that time that I didn’t want this to impact anyone else's family members.

As with many things, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a great deal of stress within hospital walls. Healthcare workers are at the center of this **stressful environment** with longer working hours and physical fatigue from personal protective equipment causing non-ideal working conditions1 . As a result, this is leaving many patients without services they would normally be provided and nurses and providers too overwhelmed to provide any “non-essential” services.

All of these issues have only pushed further into light to issues that face patients and the lack of priority put on patient satisfaction and well-being. In hard times like these with Hospitals being under even greater stress it is time for reform. This is where Helous comes into play. Had Helous been implemented in the above hospital my parents would have been able to order from food services without any needed help from hospital staff and on a completely transparent platform. This is an issue that has not only happened to my parents but patients all around the country during these troubling times. Helous is meant to solve this issue by providing an easy and transparent system for patients of any technical ability to seamlessly place meal orders while also eliminating the amount of contact they have with other people and raising patient satisfaction.

Our healthcare and front-line workers have gone above and beyond what has been asked of them during this Pandemic but even superheroes cannot do everything. We need to find ways to help aid healthcare workers during this and make sure that patients are still able to have the care they deserve when no one else can be by their side. Helous is just one step in this directions that may help our patients and providers be able to thrive through these hard times.
